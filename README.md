# Air Web

A demo visualization built with Astro and Air.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ The project is not complete. I'm a junior/mid frontend dev at best, so I wasn't able to finish the data visualization. The rest is basically ok. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

I left the generate code for the potential data visualization in the `DataPicker.astro` file, but it seems like Astro is a bad choice over react as it's either under-documented (so LLMs do not have "experience" with it yet) or has some DOM issues I cannot figure out on my own.

## Run the project:

Clone the repo and:

`npm install && npm run dev` or `npm install && npm run build && npm run preview`
